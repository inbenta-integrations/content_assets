## Description
The content assets in this repository are meant to help you get started building your Inbenta Chatbot.

## AIML files
AIML stands for Artificial Intelligence Markup Language. It is a XML-based dialect used to build natural language interactions. AIML is intended for handling off-topic conversations, its limited scalability being constrained by how much a human can teach the engine (as opposed to Inbenta's semantic engine).
The two AIML files in this repository allow you to enabled basic sentiment detection for your chatbot.
You can find more information about AIML files in our [Help Center](https://help.inbenta.io/en/chatbot/knowledge/aiml/).

## Dialog templates
The dialog templates are a set of sample dialogs (in JSON format) that you can upload to your Inbenta instance to easily get started with our Dialog Manager.
You can find more information about the Dialog Manager in our [Help Center](https://help.inbenta.io/en/chatbot/knowledge/dialog-manager/).
